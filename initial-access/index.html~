<h1>The Game of Life</h1>

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented by the mathematician John 
Conway in 1970. It takes place on a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of 
which can be either alive or dead. During each step, or generation, 
the state of each cell changes depending on its neighbors:
<p>

<ul>
<li>A cell that is alive stays alive if it has 2 or 3 live neighbors 
(adjacent cells). Otherwise, it dies.</li>
<p>
<li>A dead cell comes to life if it has exactly 3 live neighbors. 
Otherwise, it stays dead.</li>

</ul>

<p>

This results in some interesting patterns, including "still lifes," which
 do not change; "oscillators," which go through patterns; and "spaceships,"
 which move across the grid.
<p>
This program is a Python implementation of the Game of Life, based on a 
<a href="https://trinket.io/pygame/447e96f4d4">program</a> by Christian Jacobs.
